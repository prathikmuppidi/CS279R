## Documentation:

###### index.html

Holds the browser document information about the structure of the HTML page

###### styles.css

A style and apperance for any HTML tag can be seen in this file.
It uses unique 'class' names to indentify the right tag and embellish it with approriate appearance settings.

###### main_logic.js

This javascript file holds all the main logic in manipulating the tasks that are entered. As a user enters a task, a
javascirpt listener is triggered and adds the task and its corresponding metadata (ex. status) to a 'list' that is stored in the
browser. This 'list' then gets used to update the view pane by updating the HTML code with tags that javascript finds appropriate.
